title: About Me
---
I am a father of 2 lovely boys and lucky enough to be married to my best friend, my wife. 

I have a strong background in IT from leaving school back in the dark ages of the year 2002 up to now. I started by completing my degree in software development and then continued on the grow and really never stopped learning. A passion for learning and discovering is my drive. Be it professional or personnel. I believe that every person in the room has the capability to add value, and everyone else can learn from one another. So to approach each new situation as a student with an open mind and an open heart has not let me down so far.

In my personnel capacity, I enjoy a good run on tarmac or the trials any day, and love challenging myself. I am lucky to enjoy this passion along with my wife, and playing the support role every now and then is also humbling.

I a professional capacity, I love getting my hands dirty with code and appreciate good architecture. I believe there is no one silver bullet the same way as there is no one motor vehicle that is the best. It all depends on the use case and the scale of the solution. I also love data analytics and business intelligence, so building data infrastructure and analytics gets my heart pumping the same way as spinning up a new API or VSCode project. In terms of tech stack and language, I feel that the same rule applies as with architecture. It all depends on the team, background, company and the solution. So being open-minded in adopting new technologies is key for me.
