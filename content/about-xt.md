title: About Xebra Tech
---
Xebra Tech is a contracting company that specializes in software development and migration architecture. 

With today's fast-evolving landscape many software developers and technical leads might feel like they are falling behind. This is true to a certain extent, but many people take the experience for granted. Combining experience with new powerful tech stacks gives you the business edge.

Migrating or taking on new technology with a big project without taking into consideration the return on investment for such a move can be more costly than making smaller iterative decisions to evolve what is in place into a mature new-age system without compromising any downstream projects or clients. 

That is where XT fits in. Forming a sound strategy around developing a new greenfield solution or killing the monolith or even extending the monolith. Helping you to make the right choice for what you need today, and to align you for tomorrow.
